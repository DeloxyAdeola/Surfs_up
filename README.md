-The biggest difference between months is the minimum temperature. June's min temperature is 64, but December's is only 56.
-The std for June is 3.26 while that of December is 3.75 with a differnce of 0.49.

The Analysis 
To begin my analysis base of the weather in Awahoo.
I imported my dependencies which will make it easy for my queries.
When analyzing the results of the temperature data, I came to the conclusion that this business will be well set up in Oahu. The temperature data for June and December were very similar, meaning there should be plenty of good surfing and ice cream days throughout the year. W. Avy should feel confident about their business being located here. An additional query I would recommend would be one analyzing the precipitation in different months throughout the year in Oahu. I would also recommend a query analyzing the winds around Oahu to try to get a greater sense of what its effect is on the waves in Oahu.
